/**
   \brief This module handles the totality propery on bound constraints:
   \f$t_1 \le t_2\f$ or \f$t_2 \le t_1\f$. Pre-processing rewrites all 
   equalities between arithmetic terms as a conjunction of two inequalities
   that are related by the totality property.

   This module provides a function to register all such equalities
   (totality_register), a function to generate the instances of the
   totality property corresponding to such equalities (totality_lemmas)
   and a function to test if two literals correspond to the atoms of a
   previously generated lemma (totality_check).
