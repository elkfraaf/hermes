Description
  - This image contains a script "dispatcher.py" that runs SMT-LIB 2 files using various solvers.
  - The script runs in two modes:
    - normal: running the query using a portfolio of solvers. 
              The solvers are chosen based on the results
              of the last SMT-COMP.
              Roughly speaking, the best 4 solvers for the logic of the query are used.
              The current pool of solvers includes:
              CVC4, Z3, Yices, VERIT, MATHSAT, SPASS_SATT
    - generic: running the query using CVC4

Installation:
  - cd to the main directory
  - run:
    # docker build -t dispatcher .
    # docker run -it dispatcher
    # cd dispatcher
    # make

Usage:
  - if needed, run the following command again:
    # docker run -it img
  - run:
    # cd dispatcher
    # python3 dispatcher.py <path> -s <mode>
    where:
      - <path> is the path to an smt2 file
      - <mode> is either "normal" (for running a portfolio) or "generic" (for running CVC4)

Example:
  - The following run will return a result quickly: 
    # python3 dispatcher.py examples/smtlib/term-UCZhjg.smt2 -s normal
  -The following run will take long time (few minutes) before terminating:
    # python3 dispatcher.py examples/smtlib/term-UCZhjg.smt2 -s generic

Additional Options:
- Using the -s option, <mode> can have more values than "generic" or "normal". 
  It can be a space-separated list of solver names, to be used in portfolio.
- Using -v will dump some debug details
