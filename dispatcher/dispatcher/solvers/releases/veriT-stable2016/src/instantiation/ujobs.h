   \brief Module for handling unification jobs

   A unification job is a triple <D0, pol, D1> in which D0, D1 are DAGs and pol
   is a boolean.  At least D0 is nonground. There are two kinds of unification
   jobs, determined by the polarity:
   - if pol = true, find unifiers u such that D0u = D1u
   - if pol = false, find unifiers u such that D0u != D1u

   All found unifiers, if any, are associated with <D0, pol, D1>, therefore
   avoiding the recomputation of these unifiers whenever the same job occurs
   again.

   Such jobs are indexed primarily by D0, then by pol and finally by D1. */

   \remark the result of a ujob is stored with unifiers based on the variables
   of that context. The same ujob may appear in a different context, however, so
   although the same DAGs compose the job the resulting unifiers must be reset
   to the current variables.

   E.g. in the context of a clause with free variables {x1, x2} the ujob <fx1,
   T, ft> will be indexed with the resulting unifier {x1/t, x2/x2}. If this same
   ujob appear in a context with free variables {x1, x3} the retrieved unifier
   will be {x1/t, x3/x3} */
