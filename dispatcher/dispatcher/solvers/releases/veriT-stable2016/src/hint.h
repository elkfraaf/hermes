  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Module for hints, i.e., theory propagation

  Maintains information used to build conflict clauses 
  including hints.

  Some hints have no such information, and have to be
  notified directly with SAT_lit.

  Other hints are notified with the routines of this module
  (hint_CC and hint_LA).

  IMPROVE: The software architecture for handling hints is not
  satisfactory. It is an adaptation of a version where only
  CC produced hints to include hints from linear arithmetics.
